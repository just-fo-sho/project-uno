The date is August 30th.  I've started to read the ultra learning book.  I ate too much Korean food so I took a nap.  

I did a lot of reading today.  I always feel like I don't do enough.  This is clearly a habit of my mind.  

Anyway, gonna go to the bar later and get drinks with Laura.  That should be fun.
